# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

We have the following problem: 

We have a ticketing system. This system shall receive and send emails. But the system is to big to do this synchronously. We always have problems with the mail server. It will sometimes just not send an email because of some limit. We want to make it more failsafe.

What software architecture would you suggest in this case?
