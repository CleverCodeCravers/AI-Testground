# Creating subtasks for tasks

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
```

We just got this task by mail. Can you create a list of tasks and subtasks that we need to perform to solve that request?

### Validation

Check the task list. Does it make sense?

### Result

Sure, here's a list of tasks and subtasks you could perform to address the issue:

1. Verify the reported issue:

- Check the monitoring sensor data to confirm the backup status on 25.03 at 12:36.
- Review Veeam logs to verify if there were any errors during the backup process.
- Investigate if there are any other indications of issues or errors with the backup process.

2. Check the Veeam 12 patch:

- Verify if there are any known issues with the latest patch (12.0.0.1420 P20230412) that could be causing the backup failures.
- Review Veeam's patch release notes and documentation to identify potential problems.

3. Evaluate PowerShell or API queries:

- Verify the PowerShell or API queries that were used for monitoring the backup status.
- Check if the queries are accurate and reliable, and if they cover all relevant aspects of the backup process.
- Consider alternative monitoring methods, if necessary.

4. Identify root cause and resolve the issue:

- Identify the root cause of the backup failures and determine the necessary steps to resolve the issue.
- Consider the impact of the issue on the customer's data and systems, and take appropriate measures to minimize the impact.
- Communicate the findings and resolution steps to the customer.

5. Prevent future issues:

- Implement measures to prevent similar backup failures in the future.
- Review and adjust the backup processes and procedures as needed.
- Provide guidance to the customer on best practices for backup monitoring and management.
