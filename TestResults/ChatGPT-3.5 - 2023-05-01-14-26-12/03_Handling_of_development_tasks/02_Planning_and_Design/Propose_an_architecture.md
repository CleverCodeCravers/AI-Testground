## Prompt 1

We have the following problem:

We have a ticketing system. This system shall receive and send emails. But the system is to big to do this synchronously. We always have problems with the mail server. It will sometimes just not send an email because of some limit. We want to make it more failsafe.

What software architecture would you suggest in this case?

### Validation

### Result

To address the issue of the ticketing system being too big to send and receive emails synchronously, and to make it more failsafe, I would recommend considering an asynchronous architecture using message queues.

Here are some potential steps you could take:

1. Set up a message queue system, such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.
2. Modify the ticketing system to use a message queue to send and receive emails asynchronously, rather than directly interfacing with the email server.
3. Configure the message queue system to handle any necessary message buffering or throttling to prevent issues with the email server.
4. Implement message retries and failure handling to ensure that any failed email sends are retried automatically or escalated as needed.
5. Consider implementing a monitoring and alerting system to track message queue status and alert administrators to any issues with message delivery or processing.
6. Document the new architecture and any necessary configuration or maintenance steps for future reference.

Using a message queue system can help to decouple the ticketing system from the email server, allowing for more reliable and resilient message delivery. Additionally, it can provide scalability and flexibility for handling large volumes of messages or future growth of the system.
