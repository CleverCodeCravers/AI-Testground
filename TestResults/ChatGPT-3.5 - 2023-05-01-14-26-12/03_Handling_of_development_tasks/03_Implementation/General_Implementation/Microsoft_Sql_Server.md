# Microsoft SQL Server

## Prompt 1

Can you please give me the sql for a microsoft sql server for a employee equipment administration software?

### Result

Certainly, here is an example of an SQL database schema for an employee equipment administration software:

```
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Position VARCHAR(50),
    HireDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Equipment (
    EquipmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Type VARCHAR(50),
    Manufacturer VARCHAR(50),
    Model VARCHAR(50),
    SerialNumber VARCHAR(50),
    PurchaseDate DATE,
    WarrantyExpirationDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE EmployeeEquipment (
    EmployeeID INT,
    EquipmentID INT,
    AssignmentDate DATE,
    ReturnDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, EquipmentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID),
    FOREIGN KEY (EquipmentID) REFERENCES Equipment(EquipmentID)
);
```

This SQL creates three tables:

1. The `Employees` table which contains the basic information about the employees, such as their first and last names, department, position, and hire date.
2. The `Equipment` table which contains the information about the equipment, such as its type, manufacturer, model, serial number, purchase date, and warranty expiration date.
3. The `EmployeeEquipment` table which is used to track the assignment of equipment to employees. It has foreign keys to the `Employees` and `Equipment` tables and includes information such as the assignment and return dates.

Note that this is just an example schema and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements.
