# Python

## Prompt 1

Please write me a small python script that will use gpt3.5 to answer a question.

### Result

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to the GPT-3.5 API or any other external APIs. However, I can give you an example of how to use OpenAI's GPT-3 API with the `openai` Python module. Here's an example script that prompts the user for a question and generates an answer using the OpenAI API:

```python
import openai_secret_manager
import openai

# Set up the API credentials
secrets = openai_secret_manager.get_secret("openai")
openai.api_key = secrets["api_key"]

# Get the user's question
question = input("What is your question? ")

# Call the OpenAI API to generate an answer
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-002",
    prompt=f"Q: {question}\nA:",
    max_tokens=1024,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.5,
)

# Print the generated answer
answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(answer)
```

Note that you'll need to install the `openai` module by running `pip install openai` before running this script. Also, you'll need to have an API key for the OpenAI API, which you can obtain from the OpenAI website.
