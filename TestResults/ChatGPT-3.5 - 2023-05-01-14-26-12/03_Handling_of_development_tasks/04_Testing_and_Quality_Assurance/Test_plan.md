# Develop a test plan

## Prompt 1

We have a ticketing system.
Can you develop a test plan for us?

### Result

Sure, here's an example test plan for a ticketing system:

1. Ticket submission tests

- Test that a new ticket can be successfully submitted with all required fields (title, description, priority, etc.) filled out.
- Test that submission fails if required fields are not filled out.
- Test that attachments can be successfully added to a ticket.
- Test that an error message is displayed if attachment upload fails.
- Test that the ticket submission form validates user input and provides appropriate error messages.

2. Ticket management tests

- Test that tickets can be assigned to users or teams.
- Test that tickets can be edited and updated.
- Test that ticket status can be changed (open, closed, resolved, etc.).
- Test that a ticket can be closed only if all required fields are filled out.
- Test that a ticket cannot be edited or updated if it has been closed.

3. User management tests

- Test that new users can be added to the system.
- Test that user profiles can be edited and updated.
- Test that user roles and permissions can be assigned.
- Test that user login and authentication works properly.

4. Email integration tests

- Test that email notifications are sent when a new ticket is submitted.
- Test that email notifications are sent when a ticket is assigned, updated, or resolved.
- Test that email notifications can be customized and configured by the administrator.

5. Reporting and analytics tests

- Test that system administrators can generate reports on ticket volume, response time, resolution time, etc.
- Test that reports can be customized and filtered based on various criteria (date range, ticket type, priority, etc.)
- Test that analytics tools can be integrated to provide insight into ticket trends and user behavior.

6. Security and data integrity tests

- Test that user data is stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.
- Test that the system can handle high volumes of traffic and requests without crashing or slowing down.
- Test that the system can recover from errors or crashes without losing data.
- Test that the system has proper backup and disaster recovery procedures in place.

These are just some examples of the types of tests that could be included in a comprehensive test plan for a ticketing system. The specific tests will depend on the features and functionality of the system, as well as the specific requirements and use cases.
