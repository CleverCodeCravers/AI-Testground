# Creating subtasks for tasks

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
```

We just got this task by mail. Can you create a list of tasks and subtasks that we need to perform to solve that request?

### Validation

Check the task list. Does it make sense?

### Result

1. Acknowledge the received request

   - Reply to the customer acknowledging the issue and informing them that the team is investigating

2. Review the customer's environment

   - Gather information about the customer's infrastructure, backup setup, and configuration

3. Investigate the issue with Veeam 12
   a. Review Veeam 12 documentation and release notes
   b. Check for known issues related to the problem
   c. Research the latest patch and its potential impact on backup monitoring

4. Analyze the monitoring sensor data
   a. Verify the sensor configuration and settings
   b. Investigate the discrepancy between the sensor's successful backup indication and the actual backup failure
   c. Check for any signs of communication issues between the sensor and the backup system

5. Examine the backup logs
   a. Analyze the backup logs from the past 4 days
   b. Identify any error messages or warnings related to the backup failures
   c. Check for any patterns or similarities across failed backups

6. Test querying the backup status
   a. Replicate the method used by the monitoring system (PowerShell or API) to query the backup status
   b. Validate the accuracy of the returned information
   c. Identify any issues with the querying method

7. Implement a solution
   a. Depending on the findings, develop and apply a fix for the issue
   b. Update the monitoring system or backup configuration, if necessary

8. Verify the solution
   a. Run a test backup to ensure the monitoring system accurately reports the backup status
   b. Monitor the backup status over a few days to confirm that the issue is resolved

9. Communicate with the customer

   - Provide the customer with a detailed report of the findings, implemented solution, and any recommended changes or updates
   - Confirm with the customer that the issue is resolved and their backups are running successfully

10. Document the issue and solution

- Create a knowledge base article or internal documentation to help address similar issues in the future
