## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

Please answer the following questions:

1. Which customers are involved?
2. Which of our software systems is involved?
3. What is the problem?
4. Where is the problem? (Software, URL, anything related to the location of the problem)
5. What is the current state of the system?
6. What state should the system have instead so that it is considered working correctly?
7. Is there a contact person given in this text?

### Validation

The answers match the given text.

### Result

1. The customer involved is Megacorp.
2. The software system involved is Veeam 12.
3. The problem is that the monitoring sensor falsely reported a successful backup, while the backup actually failed. This led to the issue going unnoticed for the past 4 days.
4. The problem is related to the monitoring system of Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412). The location of the problem is within the monitoring sensor and its querying method (PowerShell or API).
5. The current state of the system is that it inaccurately reports backup success even when the backup has failed.
6. The system should accurately report the backup status so that failed backups are immediately identified and addressed.
7. A contact person is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the sender of the message is named Stefan.
