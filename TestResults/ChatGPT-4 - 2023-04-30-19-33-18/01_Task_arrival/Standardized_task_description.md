# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan
