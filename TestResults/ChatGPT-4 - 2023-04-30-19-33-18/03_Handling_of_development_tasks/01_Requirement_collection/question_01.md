# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

Please answer the following questions:

1. Who is affected by the task?
2. Can you suggest solutions to this problem?

### Validation

He was able to identify the affected side. The suggested solutions are not bad at all.

### Result

1. The customer Megacorp is affected by the task, as well as the SWE team who needs to investigate and resolve the issue.

2. Suggested solutions to this problem include:

   a. Investigate the monitoring sensor's configuration and settings to identify any discrepancies in backup status reporting.

   b. Analyze backup logs to detect errors, warnings, or patterns that may have caused the backup failures.

   c. Verify the accuracy of the backup status querying method (PowerShell or API) and identify any potential issues.

   d. Review Veeam 12 documentation and release notes, specifically looking for known issues or patch-related impacts on backup monitoring.

   e. Implement a more robust monitoring system that ensures accurate backup status reporting, and possibly includes alerts for consecutive backup failures to prevent similar issues in the future.
