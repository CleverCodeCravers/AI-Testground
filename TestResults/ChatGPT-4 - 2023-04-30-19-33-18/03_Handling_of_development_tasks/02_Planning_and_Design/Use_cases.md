Title: Use Case - Ticket Creation and Resolution

Actors:

1. Customer (End User)
2. Support Agent
3. System Administrator (Optional)

Preconditions:

1. The customer has access to the ticketing system (either through a web portal or email).
2. The support agent is logged into the ticketing system and has access to the support queue.

Use Case Description:

1. The customer encounters an issue or has a question related to the product or service.

2. The customer accesses the ticketing system and creates a new support ticket. They provide a detailed description of the issue, along with any relevant attachments, screenshots, or log files.

3. The ticketing system assigns a unique identifier to the new ticket and adds it to the support queue.

4. A notification is sent to the support agent informing them of the new ticket.

5. The support agent reviews the ticket and, if necessary, gathers additional information from the customer through the ticketing system's communication features (e.g., comments or messaging).

6. The support agent investigates the issue, identifies a solution, and provides the customer with the necessary steps to resolve the issue or answers the customer's question.

7. If the support agent is unable to resolve the issue, they may escalate the ticket to a system administrator or a more experienced support agent.

8. Once the customer confirms that their issue has been resolved or their question has been answered, the support agent closes the ticket.

9. The ticketing system may request the customer to provide feedback on their support experience, which can be used for improving the quality of support services.

Postconditions:

1. The customer's issue is resolved or their question is answered.
2. The support agent has documented the solution in the ticketing system for future reference.
3. The ticket is closed, and the support agent is available to handle the next ticket in the support queue.
