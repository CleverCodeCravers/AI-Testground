## Prompt 1

Can you please give me the sql for a mysql server for a employee equipment administration software?

### Result

Here's an example of SQL schema for an employee equipment administration software using MySQL. The schema contains tables for employees, equipment types, equipment, and equipment assignments.

```sql
-- Create employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL
);

-- Create equipment_types table
CREATE TABLE equipment_types (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Create equipment table
CREATE TABLE equipment (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    equipment_type_id INT NOT NULL,
    serial_number VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    purchase_date DATE NOT NULL,
    warranty_expiration_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (equipment_type_id) REFERENCES equipment_types(id)
);

-- Create equipment_assignments table
CREATE TABLE equipment_assignments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    equipment_id INT NOT NULL,
    assignment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    return_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (equipment_id) REFERENCES equipment(id)
);
```

This schema includes the following tables:

1. `employees`: Stores employee information such as first name, last name, email, and hire date.
2. `equipment_types`: Stores equipment types with their name and description.
3. `equipment`: Stores equipment information, including a reference to the equipment type, serial number, purchase date, and warranty expiration date.
4. `equipment_assignments`: Stores the assignment of equipment to employees, including assignment and return dates.

Execute the SQL commands above in your MySQL server to create the tables for the employee equipment administration software.
