# Python

## Prompt 1

Please write me a small python script that will use gpt3.5 to answer a question.

### Result

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, OpenAI has not released GPT-3.5. The most recent version available is GPT-3. However, I can provide you with a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to access GPT-3 and answer a question.

First, you'll need to have an API key from OpenAI. If you haven't already, sign up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/ and get your API key.

Next, install the `openai` package using pip:

```
pip install openai
```

Here is a Python script to use GPT-3 to answer a question:

```python
import openai

# Replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual API key
openai.api_key = "your_api_key_here"

# Replace 'your_question_here' with the question you want to ask GPT-3
question = "your_question_here"

def ask_gpt3(question):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex",
        prompt=f"{question}\n\nAnswer:",
        temperature=0.5,
        max_tokens=100,
        top_p=1,
        frequency_penalty=0,
        presence_penalty=0,
        stop=["\n"],
    )

    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return answer

answer = ask_gpt3(question)
print("Question:", question)
print("Answer:", answer)
```

Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key and `"your_question_here"` with the question you'd like to ask GPT-3. The script will print the answer to the question. Note that this script uses the "davinci-codex" engine, which is a powerful model in the GPT-3 family, but you can change it to other engines such as "davinci", "curie", or "babbage" depending on your needs and API limits.
