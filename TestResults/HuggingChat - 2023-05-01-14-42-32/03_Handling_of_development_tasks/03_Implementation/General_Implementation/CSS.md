# CSS Test

## Prompt 1

Can you build me the CSS for a basic grid layout with 12 columns as well as an example in HTML that uses this layout.

### Result

Certainly! Here's some sample CSS for creating a basic grid layout with 12 equal-width columns using Flexbox:

```css
.container {
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
width: auto; /_ or set a fixed width _/
}

.item {
flex: 1 0 auto; /_ adjust item size according to available space _/
padding: 1rem;
}

```

In this example, we are setting up a container element (div.container) to use Flexbox and establishing two directions â€“ row to stack elements horizontally, and auto to make the container fill the entire width available to it. Then each .item inside the container would take one column and automatically adjust its size within its parent row depending on other items next to it. Finally, adding some padding on each .item can provide better separation and spacing between them.

For an example implementation in HTML using Bootstrap, here's what your page could look like:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css"
/>
<style>
  .my-grid {
    border-radius: 1em;
  }
</style>
<div id="grid-container" class="d-flex my-grid"></div>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const $items = $("#grid-container").find(".grid-item");

  $items.each((index, elm) => {
    $(document).trigger("initGridItem", { itemIndex: index + 1 });
  });
</script>
```

This implementation creates a parent container (<div id="grid-container"...>), applies CSS classes to style the container and rows, initializes the layout by triggering JavaScript events upon each child element creation ($("#grid-container")), and includes all necessary dependencies and scripts in <head>. Note that using these libraries requires linking to external files.
