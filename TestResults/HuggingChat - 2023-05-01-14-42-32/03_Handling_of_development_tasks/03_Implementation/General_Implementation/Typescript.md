# Typescript

## Prompt 1

Can you write me a small typescript application with nodejs:

- Write an npm library
- It should parse netscape cookies.
- Use interfaces and types if necessary.

### Result

Sure! To start creating an NPM package that parses Netscape cookies, follow these steps:

    Setup your Node environment: Open your command prompt and make sure you have Node.js and npm installed globally on your system. If not, you can follow the official installation guide from the Node website. Also install TypeScript globally using this command:

npm install -g typescript@latest

Note: The latest version may differ at the time of writing. 2. Create your project folder: Navigate to your desired location where you want to store the entire project, including packages. Then, create a new subdirectory inside it and initialize your project as a Node Package Manager (NPM) library:

mkdir mycookieparser
cd mycookieparser
npm init -y

    Initialize the project as a TypeScript project: After completing the NPM initialization, create a new file named "package.json" (if it doesn't exist yet) and add "types": [" CookieParser",] under "devDependencies". Replace "CookieParser" with your package name. Mine will be mycookieparser.
    Install required dependencies: Install both 'node-cookie' and 'tslib' as devDependencies in your package.json:

npm install tslib@latest node-cookie@latest --save-dev

    Define cookie types: Create another JavaScript file named cookie.d.ts (or any other name you prefer) alongside your main ./src/index.ts. Include it in your project and add type definitions for various cookie formats, such as the widely used RFC6265 standard. We use interface keywords (declare namespace) from the TSLINT project along with the @types/node definition provided by Microsoft:

```typescript
/// .d.ts files define type extensions for existing native ECMAScript modules.
/// This one includes cookie parsing types.
namespace MyCookieParser_Types {}
module "./mycookieparser_types" {
export interface ExtractedSetCookies extends Array<string | undefined | null> {
**proto**: (Array<string | undefined | null> & { length?: number; })['prototype'];
}
...
}
```

    Implement your functionality: In your main ./src/index.ts file, import th
