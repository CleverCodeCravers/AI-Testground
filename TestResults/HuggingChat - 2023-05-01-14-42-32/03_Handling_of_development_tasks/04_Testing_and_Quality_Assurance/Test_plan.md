# Develop a test plan

## Prompt 1

We have a ticketing system.
Can you develop a test plan for us?

### Result

Developing a comprehensive test plan for a tickets system requires understanding the requirements, functionality, target audience, user scenarios, acceptance criteria, etc. Based on our experience across many industries and domains, we suggest starting with the following key areas and elements within each area:

Area 1: System Functionality Tests

- Verify the main features work as expected throughout different states/modes (New Ticket > Open Ticket > Closed Ticket > Archived Ticket). Examples include creating new tickets, viewing/editing/deleting ticket data, assigning to agents/teams, setting priorities, attaching files, adding notes/comments, searching/filtering tickets, and generating reports.
- Ensure proper ticket workflow (status updates, auto-assignments, escalations) based on custom business rules, SLA policies, and triggers (inbound/outbound emails, chatbot interactions, webhooks, integrations). This includes handling edge cases (invalid transitions, circular loops, deadlock situations) due to conflicting conditions or incorrect input. For example: "If priority is Critical and due date has passed, then change status to 'Urgent'; unless priority is Low, in which case set status to 'Acknowledged'."
- Verify the integration points between various systems (e.g., CRM, knowledge base, project management tool, collaboration platform) with regards to data synchronization, authentication, API calls, and error handling. Check interoperability issues with different browsers, devices, operating systems, networks, time zones, languages, regional settings, accessibility options, etc.

Area 2: Security & Privacy Tests

- Validate the security controls against unauthorized access, tampering, disclosure, modification, destruction, deletion, breaches, violations, DDoS attacks, SQL injection attempts, zero-day vulnerabilities, and unintended consequences from insider threats. Conduct thorough risk assessments and penetration tests according to industry standards (OWASP Top Ten Risks, NIST Cybersecurity Framework). Cover confidentiality, integrity, availabilit
