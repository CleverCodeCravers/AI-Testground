# Creating subtasks for tasks

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
```

We just got this task by mail. Can you create a list of tasks and subtasks that we need to perform to solve that request?

### Validation

Check the task list. Does it make sense?

### Result

    - Check the logs from Veeam server and the customer network to identify if there were any errors during the backup process on March 25th at 12:36 PM
    - Verify if the monitoring system sent notifications to alert personnel of any failed backups since then until now. If no notifications were received, investigate why.
    - Investigate potential causes for the failure of the monitored backup. Consider possible reasons such as:
        - Hardware failures on the storage device(s) used for backups
        - Network connectivity problems
        - Veeam configuration issues
    - Determine whether this issue appears to be isolated to this specific customer, or if there may be a problem affecting other customers using Veeam version 12.
    - Explore the feasibility of checking the status through API or PowerShell queries.
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of available tools to monitor Veeam backups continuously. Suggest improvements where necessary.
