## Prompt 1

We have a ticketing system.

Can you write us some user stories for it?

### Validation

### Result

Sure, here are five user stories to guide development efforts for the ticketing system:

    1. As a customer service representative, I want to easily manage a high volume of support requests from our customers. User story goals are to simplify processing multiple tickets at once, quickly identify priority issues, filter cases by categories, and sort by attributes like due date, status, etc., enabling reps to better organize their workload. They need to assign and track responsibilities effectively, leaving clear comments and notes visible only to authorized team members during collaboration within the platform. Additional objectives involve providing useful reporting capabilities to supervisors, making it easy for them to monitor performance metrics like response time, SLA compliance, agent availability, and customer satisfaction levels.
    2. From the perspective of an IT technician responsible for resolving technical problems, I need access to detailed information about reported incidents while handling several cases simultaneously. Relevant requirements include displaying tech specs of equipment involved, network diagnostic results, error logs, screenshot attachments or other files, links to online resources relevant to troubleshooting steps already taken, etc. Technicians benefit most from tools facilitating accurate record keeping; they must document their investigative process, solutions attempted, vendor communication, customer interactions, next actions planned, and relevant timestamps throughout resolution proceedings. Seamless integration between different systems, apps, services, or platforms simplifies their job considerably since context-switching frequently impedes efficiency.
    3. In line with an application developer's role, I require efficient tracking of software bugs detected by clients or encountered internally. An ideal scenario involves automatic linking related issues found within various projects/modules for easier cross-referencing, associating source code changes made to address defects, and flagging dependencies among affected components. Developer URIs focus on streamlining bug fixing by reducing time spent searching through duplicate reports, monitoring patch releases, noti
