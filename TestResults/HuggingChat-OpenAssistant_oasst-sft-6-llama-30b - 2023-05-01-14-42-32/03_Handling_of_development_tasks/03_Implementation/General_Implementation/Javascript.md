# Javascript

## Prompt 1

Can you write me a small javascript application with nodejs:

- Write an npm library
- It should parse netscape cookies.

### Result

Sure, I can help you create a simple Node.js application that reads Netscape cookies and returns their values in JSON format. This will involve writing a command-line tool (either directly executable via Node.js or packaged into an NPM package) that takes cookie data (e.g., through stdin input) as a parameter and outputs a parsed result to stdout output. We won't include reading from stdin here but rather rely on user input when executing this script from the command line. If needed, let me know how we might handle cookies passed in command line parameters?

Here is a code snippet showing the minimal setup and structure of our project:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const readline = require("readline");

module.exports = {
  main: async () => {
    console.log("No cookies found");

    // Read stdin input which contains cookie string, e.g.: "NAME=John DOMAIN=example.com SECURE=FALSE"
    const cookies = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout,
      });

      rl.question(`Enter cookie string: `, resolve);
    });

    // Split the given cookie string by newline characters to get individual names and values
    const [nameValuePairs] = cookies.split("\n");

    // Parse each name-value pair to extract key-value pairs, mapping keys to arrays of corresponding values
    const results = {};
    for (const nameValPair of nameValuePairs) {
      const [name, val] = nameValPair.trim().split("=").map(encodeURIComponent);
      results[decodeURIComponent(name)] = [
        val === "" ? null : decodeURIComponent(val),
      ];
    }

    console.json(results);
  },
};
```

I have defined a minimum boilerplate object named after the module exports keyword main, containing an async function. Inside the async function, there are a few lines of code performing the actual logic:

    Firstly, we log an error message saying no cookies were found (which we shall replace later with proper validation to ensure cookies are present).
    Secondly, we perform synchronous input from the CLI w
