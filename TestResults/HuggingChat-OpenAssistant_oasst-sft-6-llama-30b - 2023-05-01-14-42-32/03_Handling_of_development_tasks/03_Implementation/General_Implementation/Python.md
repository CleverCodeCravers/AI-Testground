Using GPT 3.5 to Answer Questions With Python: PyTorch Implementation

If you need assistance with any aspect of writing code or executing it on GPT 3.5, I can provide detailed explanations and helpful tips!

Prerequisites:

    1. Python: You must have Python installed on your machine. The latest version works best but is not strictly necessary.
    2. PyTorch: Visit the official website (<https://pytorch.org/>) and download the appropriate version according to your OS. Make sure to add ~/.conda/envs/my_env (replace my_env with the desired environment name) to your PATH variable so you can run PyTorch scripts without activating the virtual environment first. Remember to restart your terminal after making changes.
    3. gpt-3-5-api: This library provides easy access to GPT 3.5, and you can install it directly from GitHub:
        git clone https://github.com/LAION-AI/gpt-3-5-api.git
        Open a new command prompt/terminal window, navigate to the project folder, then run pip install .
    4. Once you complete all prerequisites, create a directory named answer_questions_with_gpt35, then initialize a fresh virtual environment (my_venv) within it:

```
python -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/my_venv
source ~/.virtualenvs/my_venv/bin/activate # macOS, Linux (running zsh/bash)
my_venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```

Make sure to replace .virtualenvs/ with the corresponding location where you store your virtual environments on your computer (e.g., ~/Envs/). Afterward, navigate into the main directory again to begin coding.

Introduction:

In this tutorial, you will learn how to answer questions using GPT 3.5 by writing a simple Python script that utilizes the provided API. We'll take advantage of PyTorch's dataloaders and DataParallel structures to make efficient usage of the GPU. Here's what you'll accomplish in this guide:

    1. Create and import the custom dataset class.
    2. Instantiate and configure GPT-3.
    3. Define an example function that answers questions wit
