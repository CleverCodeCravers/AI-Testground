# Creating subtasks for tasks

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
```

We just got this task by mail. Can you create a list of tasks and subtasks that we need to perform to solve that request?

### Validation

Check the task list. Does it make sense?

### Result

Based on the provided email, I've created a list of tasks and subtasks that need to be performed to address the issue:

**Task 1: Investigate the Backup Issue**

- **Subtask 1.1:** Verify the backup status using PowerShell or API (as mentioned in the email)
  - Check the log files for any errors or issues related to the backup
  - Verify the backup configuration and settings
- **Subtask 1.2:** Review the Veeam patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412) and research any known issues or bugs associated with this patch level

**Task 2: Identify Potential Causes**

- **Subtask 2.1:** Research similar issues reported by other customers using Veeam 12
  - Search online forums, communities, and Veeam documentation for relevant information
  - Analyze and summarize any potential causes or solutions identified
- **Subtask 2.2:** Investigate if the latest patch (P20230412) is related to the issue
  - Research changes and updates made in this patch level
  - Verify if other customers have reported similar issues after applying this patch

**Task 3: Resolve the Issue**

- **Subtask 3.1:** Develop a plan to resolve the backup issue (e.g., re-run the backup, adjust configuration settings, etc.)
  - Based on findings from Tasks 1 and 2, propose a solution or workaround
  - Identify potential risks or side effects associated with the proposed solution
- **Subtask 3.2:** Implement the plan and monitor the result
  - Execute the chosen solution and verify its effectiveness
  - Monitor the backup process for a period to ensure it is working as expected

**Task 4: Document and Report**

- **Subtask 4.1:** Document the investigation, findings, and resolution in a clear and concise manner
  - Summarize key points and recommendations
  - Provide detailed information on any changes made or actions taken
- **Subtask 4.2:** Report the outcome to the customer (Megacorp) and other stakeholders as necessary
  - Keep the report concise, clear, and easy to understand
  - Include any relevant details, screenshots, or attachments

Please let me know if this list looks accurate or if you need further assistance!
