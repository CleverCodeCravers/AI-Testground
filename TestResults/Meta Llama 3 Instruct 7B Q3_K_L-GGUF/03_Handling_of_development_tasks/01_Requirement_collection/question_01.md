# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

### Validation

### Result

Based on the text:

1. The customer Megacorp is affected by the task.
2. As for suggesting solutions, here are a few ideas:
   - Verify the Veeam 12 configuration and patch level to ensure everything is up-to-date and correct.
   - Check the PowerShell or API query used to monitor the backup status for any issues or potential errors.
   - Investigate if there's a specific reason why the backup didn't run successfully on March 25th at 12:36, such as disk space issues, network problems, or Veeam configuration errors.
   - Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting mechanisms to ensure timely detection of backup failures in the future.

Please note that these are just initial ideas, and further investigation may be necessary to identify the root cause of the issue and find a suitable solution.
