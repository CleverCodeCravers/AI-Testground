## Prompt 1

We have the following problem:

We have a ticketing system. This system shall receive and send emails. But the system is to big to do this synchronously. We always have problems with the mail server. It will sometimes just not send an email because of some limit. We want to make it more failsafe.

What software architecture would you suggest in this case?

### Validation

### Result

Based on your problem statement, I'd suggest a software architecture that involves queuing and asynchronous processing to handle email sending. Here's a possible solution:

1. **Ticketing System**: The system receives emails and stores them in a database or a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka).
2. **Email Queue**: Implement an email queue mechanism within the ticketing system. This will allow you to store emails temporarily while waiting for the mail server to process them.
3. **Asynchronous Email Processor**: Create a separate service or worker that periodically checks the email queue and sends emails to the mail server. This service can be designed to:
   - Check the mail server limits (e.g., sender score, queue size) before sending an email.
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed emails.
   - Log errors and exceptions for debugging purposes.
4. **Load Balancing**: Consider implementing load balancing to distribute the email processing workload across multiple instances of the asynchronous email processor service. This will help increase throughput and reduce the burden on individual instances.

By introducing this architecture, you'll decouple the ticketing system from the mail server, making it more resilient to failures and mail server limitations. The asynchronous email processor can continue running even if the mail server is temporarily unavailable or reaches its limits, ensuring that emails are eventually sent without disrupting the main ticketing system.

Additionally, consider implementing monitoring and analytics to track the performance of your email sending process, including metrics such as:
_ Email processing latency
_ Success rates
_ Failure rates
_ Mail server response times

This will help you identify bottlenecks and optimize your architecture for better performance and reliability.
