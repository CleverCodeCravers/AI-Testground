# Python

## Prompt 1

Please write me a small python script that will use gpt3.5 to answer a question.

### Result

Here is a small Python script that uses the OpenAI API to interact with the GPT-3.5 model:

```python
import requests
import json

# Set the API endpoint and API key
api_endpoint = "https://api.openai.com/engines/text-davinci/v3/completions"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Define the prompt and parameters for the request
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
parameters = {
    "model": "davinci:ft-ppl-2.0",
    "prompt": prompt,
    "max_tokens": 2048,
    "temperature": 1.0,
    "top_p": 1.0,
    "stream": False
}

# Set the API key in the headers
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

# Send a POST request to the API endpoint
response = requests.post(api_endpoint, json=parameters, headers=headers)

# Check if the response was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    result = json.loads(response.text)
    print(result["choices"][0]["text"])
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

You'll need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key from OpenAI.

This script sends a POST request to the OpenAI API endpoint, passing in the prompt and parameters for the GPT-3.5 model. The response is then parsed as JSON and printed to the console.

Note: You can also use other models like "gpt-2", "gpt-3", "ada" by changing the `model` parameter.

You can also use `stream=True` in the request headers to get the result in chunks, instead of loading the whole response at once.
