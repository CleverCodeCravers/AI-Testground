# Creating subtasks for tasks

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
```

We just got this task by mail. Can you create a list of tasks and subtasks that we need to perform to solve that request?

### Validation

Check the task list. Does it make sense?

### Result

Sure, here's a list of tasks and subtasks that we can perform to solve the request:

1. Check the Veeam 12 version and patch level of the customer's environment.
2. Verify the backup job configuration and schedule on the Veeam 12 server.
3. Check the backup history to identify any missing backups or failed backups.
4. Analyze the Veeam logs to identify any issues or errors that may have occurred during the backup process.
5. Verify the backup storage location and ensure that the backups are stored in a reliable and secure location.
6. Check the backup compression and encryption settings to ensure that they are configured correctly.
7. Verify the backup job retention policy and ensure that the backups are deleted or archived according to the policy.
8. Check the backup job dependencies and ensure that all dependencies are met before the backup job runs.
9. Verify the backup job monitoring and reporting settings to ensure that the backup job is monitored and reported on correctly.
10. Recommend any necessary changes or updates to the Veeam 12 configuration or backup job settings to ensure that the backups are successful in the future.
11. Test the backup job to ensure that it runs successfully and backs up the required data.
12. Document the findings and provide a detailed report to the customer with recommendations for improving their backup process.
