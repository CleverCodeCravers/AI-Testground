# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

Please answer the following questions:

1. Which customers are involved?
2. Which of our software systems is involved?
3. What is the problem?
4. Where is the problem? (Software, URL, anything related to the location of the problem)
5. What is the current state of the system?
6. What state should the system have instead so that it is considered working correctly?
7. Is there a contact person given in this text?
