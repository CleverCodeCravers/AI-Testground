# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

Please answer the following questions:

1. Who is affected by the task?
2. Can you suggest solutions to this problem?

### Validation

### Result

1. The backup job was supposed to run for the entire Megacorp, but it failed to run for the past 4 days.
2. Yes, here are some possible solutions to this problem:
   - Check the Veeam backup job configuration to ensure that the backup job is enabled and configured correctly.
   - Verify that the backup job is included in the backup schedule and is not disabled or paused.
   - Check the Veeam backup logs for any error messages or warnings that may indicate the cause of the failure.
   - Verify that the backup job is using the correct backup target (e.g. NAS, cloud storage, etc.) and that the target is available and healthy.
   - Check the backup job history to see if there have been any previous issues with the backup job.
   - Consider upgrading to the latest patch level of Veeam 12 to see if the issue is resolved in the latest patch.
   - Contact Veeam Technical Support for further assistance.
