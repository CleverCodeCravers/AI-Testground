Use Case: Ticket Management System for a Customer Support Team

The ticket management system is used by a customer support team to manage customer queries and complaints. The system allows the team to create tickets for each customer query, assign them to the appropriate agent, and track the status of each ticket until it is resolved.

1. A customer sends an email to the support team with a query about a product.
2. The support team receives the email and creates a ticket in the ticketing system.
3. The ticket is assigned to an agent who is available to handle the query.
4. The agent logs in to the system and views the ticket details, including the customer's name, email, and the nature of the query.
5. The agent responds to the customer's query and provides a resolution to the problem.
6. The agent updates the status of the ticket to "resolved" and closes the ticket.
7. The customer receives an email notification from the system informing them that their query has been resolved.
8. The support team can track the performance of each agent by looking at the resolution time and customer satisfaction ratings.
9. The system generates reports on the number of tickets received, resolved, and pending, and the average resolution time.
10. The team can use this information to improve their customer support processes and identify areas for improvement.
