# Creating subtasks for tasks

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
```

We just got this task by mail. Can you create a list of tasks and subtasks that we need to perform to solve that request?

### Validation

Check the task list. Does it make sense?

### Result

Sure! Here's a list of tasks and sub-tasks needed to resolve the issue:

    Check Veeam 12 patch level - Subtask: Verify current patch level is 12.0.0.1420 P20230412

    Investigate why backup went unnoticed - Subtask: Review logs and customer's environment to determine cause of missed backups

    Check if similar issues exist with other customers - Subtask: Research any reported cases of similar Veeam 12 monitoring issues among other clients

    Query status via PowerShell or API - Subtask: Develop a script to retrieve backup information from the customer's environment using either method

    Provide findings and recommendations - Subtask: Analyze data gathered during investigation, including any potential patch-related issues, and present results to team for review

    Implement solution (if necessary)
