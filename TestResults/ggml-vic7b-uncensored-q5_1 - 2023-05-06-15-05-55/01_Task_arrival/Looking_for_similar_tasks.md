We just got another task, we should change the color scheme in the ticketing system. Are there already similar tasks in our backlog?

## Validation

Task 40 may be similar. It's a dark mode request...

## Result

Yes, there are several tasks related to changing the color scheme or theme of the Ticketing System in your backlog. Here are a few examples:

    Introduce gamification elements into the Ticketing System to boost user engagement and productivity. This task might include modifying the visual design to incorporate different colors, fonts, and icons that align with game mechanics.

    Design a customizable, role-based access control system for ERP software. Changing the color scheme could be part of this task if it involves updating user interface elements like buttons or menus.

    Create a dynamic dashboard for Monitoring Software that provides real-time system health insights. The visual design might need to be adjusted when introducing new data visualization features, which could involve changing colors or icons to differentiate between different types of information.

    Develop a machine learning-based anomaly detection system for the Monitoring Software. This task may include updating the model's output visualizations with distinct color schemes based on detected patterns.

    Introduce blockchain-based security features for sensitive data within the ERP software. Changing the color scheme could be part of this task if it involves updating user interface elements like buttons or menus to reflect a more secure design language.

    Design a mobile app for Monitoring Software to provide system status updates on-the-go. The visual design should align with your company's brand guidelines, and any color scheme changes would need to be consistent across both the web and mobile apps.

    Add natural language processing capabilities to the ERP software's search functionality. This task might involve updating the search results page or user interface elements like buttons or icons to reflect a new color scheme.

    Develop a sentiment analysis feature for the Ticketing System to gauge customer satisfaction. Changing the color scheme could be part of this task if it involves updating the visual design of the feedback form, email notifications, or other related components.

    Implement blockchain-based security features for sensitive data within the ERP software. This task might include modifying user interface elements like buttons or menus to reflect a more secure and encrypted design language.
