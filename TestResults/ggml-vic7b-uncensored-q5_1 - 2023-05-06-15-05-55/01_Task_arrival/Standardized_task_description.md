## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

    The customers involved are not specified in the message.

    It's not clear which software systems are involved from the information provided. Can you please provide more details on what software systems are being used by Megacorp and how they relate to the issue at hand?

    The problem is that a backup did not run for 4 days, despite it being supposed to run successfully on March 25th at 12:36 according to monitoring sensor data. It was only noticed after reviewing logs that the backup had not been running.

    There are no specific details provided regarding the location of the problem in terms of software or URL. Can you please provide more information about where the problem is located?

    The current state of the system is unknown, as there has been a failure for 4 days and it was only noticed after reviewing logs. It's not clear what the intended state of the system should be in order to consider it working correctly.

    Without more information about the desired state of the system, it's difficult to determine what that ideal state would look like. Can you please provide more details on what a "working" backup solution for Megacorp entails?
