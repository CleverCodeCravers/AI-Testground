# Creating subtasks for tasks / Check included content

## Prompt 1

```
Dear SWE Team,

We encountered an interesting challenge with the monitoring at our customer Megacorp.

According to the monitoring sensor, the backup on 25.03 at 12:36 was supposed to be successful, but it wasn't. As a result, it went unnoticed that the backup had not been running for the past 4 days.

The customer uses Veeam 12 with the current patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).

I assume you query the status via PowerShell or API. Do you have the possibility to check the facts afterwards?

I am not currently aware of similar issues with other customers, but Veeam 12 is still relatively new. It might also be related to the latest patch.

Best regards,
Stefan

Hello Stefan, thank you for reaching out to us with your challenge. We're here to help! Let's break down the issue and find a solution together.

1. The backup jobs are not running as expected on Megacorp's environment due to an unsuccessful backup that went unnoticed four days ago, affecting their Veeam 12 environment with patch level (12.0.0.1420 P20230412).
2. To address this issue, we can consider the following solutions:
   a) Verify if there are any configuration changes or updates in the latest patch that might be causing the problem. If so, reverting those changes could resolve the issue.
   b) Review and analyze logs to identify why the backup job failed four days ago. This may help determine whether it's a temporary issue or part of a larger trend.
   c) Check if there are any dependencies on other systems or services that might be causing the problem, such as network connectivity issues or resource constraints.
   d) Ensure that all necessary permissions and access rights are in place for users responsible for running backup jobs to perform their tasks successfully.
   e) Provide training sessions or documentation to help customers understand how to properly configure and manage Veeam backups to avoid similar issues in the future.
3. While we don't have any immediate reports of related issues from other customers, it is essential to monitor the situation closely and gather more information if needed. We recommend that you stay informed about any updates or changes in your environment as well as any relevant patches released by Veeam. If necessary, consult with our support team for further assistance.
4. Thank you for choosing SWE! Please let us know how we can help you better or if there's anything else on your mind. We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and look forward to a continued partnership in ensuring your success with Veeam.
